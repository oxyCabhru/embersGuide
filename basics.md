# What can Embers give you?
- gun
- fancy dwarven particles
- what the fuck are you doing?
- oh my god my head is dizzy
- and ore multiplication :)
# fine i'm gonna do it how do i start
craft the Ancient Codex (will be your *very vague and* general guidebook) and click the first tab (starts at the top, rotates clockwise). <br> now right click the nodes to mark them as done and unlock more content! easy research lol

1. the first set of things you're gonna want to make is a tinker's hammer, an ember bore, another mechanical core, some item pipes and an item extractor.
the ember bore is a 3x3 multiblock (only needs one craft, it unfolds when you place it), but it only needs to touch a single bedrock block. <br>
![ember bore valid space](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxyCabhru/embersGuide/master/images/emberborevalidspace.png)
> the orange concrete is the valid space for bedrock, only needs ONE block in this area

the only interactable face on the bore is the middle one, so we're going to EXTEND it via the mechanical core. simply place it on top to get 5 more spaces to interact with the bore!<br>we're going to want to INPUT furnace fuel to power the bore, and to OUTPUT the ember materials (ember crystal, ember shard, ember grit) <br>
for that i'll use a simple hopper to input the fuel, and an item extractor to get the ember out into a chest:

> i used storage drawers to simplify getting coal in and getting ember out through one block, of course you can just use two different chests.<br>note that the item extractor requires a redstone signal to work. ***when the bore makes a lot of noise it means it's working lol***<br>
> also, use a hammer to disconnect any pipe from any inventory or adjacent pipes (like the extractor to the ember shard drawer)

2. now that you have ember, you need to turn the ember crystal and shards (grit doesn't work) into ember power. for that, you need the **ember activator.**<br>
input ember items into the bottom part of the activator, after a bit you'll see shiny stuff in the top part of the activator. that would be sweet, sweet ember power.<br>
![ember activator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxyCabhru/embersGuide/master/images/emberactivator.png)
> ooh shiny stuff

now we're going to want to extract the ember power and store it somewhere. for storing make the **copper cell** and for transfer make **ember emitters** and **ember receptors.**<br>
place a receptor on a cell and an emitter on the top part of the activator. shift right click the receptor with a tinker's hammer to store its location, and right click the emitter to set it to the receptor. now give the emitter a redstone signal to start the transfer.<br>

> shiny stuff flying through the air

3. with ember power you can now use the **melter** and the **stamper,** for starters, in order to 2x any ore in the modpack.<br>
place the melter down, give it power in the bottom part, input ore or ingots into the top part, and extract the molten metal through a fluid extractor and fluid pipes.<br>
input the molten metal into the **stamp base**, above which there is an empty space and on top of that a **stamper.**<br>
supply the stamper with power and a stamp (bar stamp, plate stamp are the most useful), and the item will pop out.<br>
use a bin to automatically collect the item. no you can't put a drawer/chest, doesn't work. the bin only holds one stack of one item.<br>
![melter and stamper basic setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxyCabhru/embersGuide/master/images/mixerstamper.png)
> the glass block is there to signify one airspace between the base and the stamper. note that levers can be placed *on* extractors, and that extractors need redstone power to work.
> note that the hammer recipe for plates costs TWICE as much as using the stamper recipe. ***use the plate stamp or ill kiss you very hard on the lips***

this setup will multiply ore, but to progress in the mod you need to add another machine into the setup:
![mixer centrifuge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxyCabhru/embersGuide/master/images/mixercentrifuge.png)<br>
the **mixer centrifuge** has 4 internal tanks on each side of the bottom part. input molten metals to different tanks to create an alloy which will be output through the top part.<br>
![mixer centrifuge from above](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxyCabhru/embersGuide/master/images/mcbirdseye.png)
> basically the same as melter into stamper, just has another stop xd

4. now that we can make alloys, we want to make ***dawnstone.*** the alloy recipe is in JEI, but it's just match copper to gold. dawnstone is basically embers' thaumium or alchemical brass or manasteel.<br>
make some dawnstone, and with it craft at least 2 **alchemy pedestals,** an **exchange tablet,** a **beam cannon,** and a **cinder plinth.**<br>
# it's alchemy time baby
