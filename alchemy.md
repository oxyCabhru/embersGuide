# welcome to alchemy bitch
this mechanic is kinda annoying but pwetty so i dedicated a page for it.<br>
basically, to craft anything you need a *lot* of **ash piles,** which you can get by burning *literally any item* in the cinder plinth.<br>
> apiaries from rustic produce a LOT of items passively (honeycomb), in the pic below i'm using it to feed the plinth constantly items and storing the ash in a void drawer. the plinth doesnt use up too much ember so you can let it run forever.

> a suggested automatic setup. feed ember from the top, you're going to have ash for days. alternatively, craft the ashen amulet later on. I prefer this though<br>

before we use ash piles, we need to understand the process of embers' alchemy:<br>
- we need an exchange tablet, on which we would place our ingredients. place items according to how JEI says to (side items on the sides of the tablet), note how the items on the tablet are facing and adjust accordingly (in my test world it was south). yes it matters
- we need a beam cannon, which will initiate the craft. place it anywhere to aim onto the tablet. i suggest just straight above, give it power and place a button to push when you want to start the craft.
- we need alchemy pedestals. on these we put aspectus' and ash piles. more on that later

> basic alchemy setup, just a suggestion on how things should be laid out. pedestals can go anywhere, just make sure they're somewhat close to the tablet. idk the range

in JEI, alchemy recipes always have aspectus requirements:<br>
![glimmer crystal recipe example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxyCabhru/embersGuide/master/images/glimmercrystalrecipe.png)<br>
the aspectus listed here is dawnstone, so we're going to place a dawnstone aspectus on the pedestal. the number means how many **ash piles** you need to put into the pedestal with the aspectus.<br>
THIS IS A RANGE! but to succeed the craft there is only one value that works. this does mean you need to experiment.<br>
> note how there can be more than 64 of the dawnstone aspectus. for that reason we're more than likely going to need two pedestals with the dawnstone aspectus. they add up

i'm going to use the same glimmer crystal recipe as an example for how to figure out the value of ashes you need.<br>
what i personally do is use the least amount of ashes, both to conserve on it and to make sure that i know how much more i need.<br>
i will put 64 ash into one pedestal, since JEI says 64 is the minimum value of the range:<br>
![alchemy fail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxyCabhru/embersGuide/master/images/alchemyfail.gif)<br>
the recipe failed, and the item told us what we did wrong: dawnstone inaccuracy 1<br>
since we put the minimum amount of ashes, it means we need to **add** 1 ash for the recipe to succeed.<br>
yes this means you need to do every recipe twice, but hey if you write it down somewhere you know the amount without experimenting each time.<br>
happy alchemy xd
