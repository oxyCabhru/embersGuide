# ember power: how to get it, and how to store it
in embers there are two ways to store ember power:<br>
- copper cell, which holds 24k ember
- crystal cell, which holds 64k ember initially (4k per ember shard inserted)<br>

wha? yeah, the whole idea in the crystal cell is that you can ***insert ember shard/crystal to increase its storage capacity:*** 4k per shard, 24k per crystal<br>
..up to 1440k ember. lmao<br>
