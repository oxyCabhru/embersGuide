# What can Embers give you?
- gun
- fancy dwarven particles
- what the fuck are you doing?
- oh my god my head is dizzy
- and ore multiplication :)
# fine i'm gonna do it how do i start
craft the Ancient Codex (will be your *very vague and* general guidebook) and click the first tab (starts at the top, rotates clockwise). <br> now right click the nodes to mark them as done and unlock more content! easy research lol

1. the first set of things you're gonna want to make is a tinker's hammer, an ember bore, another mechanical core, some item pipes and an item extractor.
the ember bore is a 3x3 multiblock (only needs one craft, it unfolds when you place it), but it only needs to touch a single bedrock block. <br>

> the orange concrete is the valid space for bedrock, only needs ONE block in this area

the only interactable face on the bore is the middle one, so we're going to EXTEND it via the mechanical core. simply place it on top to get 5 more spaces to interact with the bore!<br>we're going to want to INPUT furnace fuel to power the bore, and to OUTPUT the ember materials (ember crystal, ember shard, ember grit) <br>
for that i'll use a simple hopper to input the fuel, and an item extractor to get the ember out into a chest:

> i used storage drawers to simplify getting coal in and getting ember out through one block, of course you can just use two different chests.<br>note that the item extractor requires a redstone signal to work. ***when the bore makes a lot of noise it means it's working lol***<br>
> also, use a hammer to disconnect any pipe from any inventory or adjacent pipes (like the extractor to the ember shard drawer)

2. now that you have ember, you need to turn the ember crystal and shards (grit doesn't work) into ember power. for that, you need the **ember activator.**<br>
input ember items into the bottom part of the activator, after a bit you'll see shiny stuff in the top part of the activator. that would be sweet, sweet ember power.<br>

> ooh shiny stuff

now we're going to want to extract the ember power and store it somewhere. for storing make the **copper cell** and for transfer make **ember emitters** and **ember receptors.**<br>
place a receptor on a cell and an emitter on the top part of the activator. shift right click the receptor with a tinker's hammer to store its location, and right click the emitter to set it to the receptor. now give the emitter a redstone signal to start the transfer.<br>
