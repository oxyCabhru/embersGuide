# What can Embers give you?
- gun
- fancy dwarven particles
- what the fuck are you doing?
- oh my god my head is dizzy

# fine i'm gonna do it how do i start
craft the Ancient Codex (will be your *very vague and* general guidebook) and click the first tab (starts at the top, rotates clockwise). <br> now right click the nodes to mark them as done and unlock more content! easy research lol
1. the first set of things you're gonna want to make is a tinker's hammer, an ember bore, another mechanical core, some item pipes and an item extractor.
the ember bore is a 3x3 multiblock (only needs one craft, it unfolds when you place it), but it only needs to touch a single bedrock block. <br>

> the orange concrete is the valid space for bedrock, only needs ONE block in this area
